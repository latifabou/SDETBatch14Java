Instance variables:
    Which are declared outside a block of code but inside a class are called instance variables.
when we should use instance variables:
    when we are planning to create multiple objects of a class, or we want to share something in multiple
    methods we should go with instance variables. They occupy the memory for longer as compared to
    local variables.
static variables:
    if an instance variable has a keyword static is called a static variable.
When we should use static variables.
    When we need to share something across the objects. we use static variables.
    but it occupies the memory for longest amount of time.
