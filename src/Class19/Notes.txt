"this" keyword:
    "this" is keyword like "class", "void"...
It used in many places:
   -for example if we have same name local variable and instance variable,we use
   "this" to explicitly refer to an instance variable.
   -we use "this()"to call a constructor inside another constructor.
Why should we learn about "this" keyword?
   -it allows us to have same name local variable and instance variable;
   -if we have same code inside two constructors,we can reuse that code from
   another constructor inside another constructor by using "this()".
Inheritance:
   Inheritance is mechanism in Java that allows us to use the fields/methods
   of one class inside anther class.
There are 4 types of inheritance:
1)single inheritance= we have only one parent and one child class.
employee-->person
2)multilevel inheritance:
  in multilevel inheritance, we have inheritance in multiples levels like grandfather
  father--son--grandson
3)hierarchical inheritance
  One parent class and multiples direct child class
4) Multiple inheritance:
 one child class can directly inherit from multiple parent classes.
 it is not supported by java because of diamond problem.
Why we should learn about inheritance?
   It also allows us to reduce duplicate code.
What is the syntax?
   we can use this feature by writing "extends" keyword when declaring a class
