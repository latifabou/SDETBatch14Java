Method overriding:
    allows us to have same name methods in parent class and child class.
Why we should learn about method overriding?
    Let say we are inheriting from a parent class that has 10 methods.We like 8 methods that we want to reuse, but
    we don't like 2 of them, we want to provide implementation in a different way.
    We use method overriding to override those 2 methods.
What is the syntax of overriding?
we simply redefine the method in a child class.
